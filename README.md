<h1 align="center"> Hey, I’m Cameron!</h1>
<h2 align="center"> Full Stack Web Developer </h2>


<p> I'm a full-stack web developer with a passion for building interesting, user-friendly, and polished projects. I am a lifelong learner that enjoys understanding new technologies and problem-solving. With a background in management and mental health, I focus on user needs and ensure applications are accessible and intuitive. My experiences have also cultivated my skills in collaboration and teamwork. I believe in the power of diverse perspectives and I’m known for fostering positive relationships within teams to drive projects forward and achieve common goals.<br><br>
I’m interested in full-stack development with a particular interest in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). I enjoy developing responsive, user-centric web applications. I am very interested in the potential for AI and Machine Learning to enhance user experiences and am always eager to learn new ways to incorporate these technologies effectively into my projects.<br><br>
I’m currently advancing my skills through a web development bootcamp, with the final term focused on mastering the MERN stack. Alongside this formal learning, I am also actively engaging in side projects (which can be seen in my featured repositories) that help me to deepen my understanding of different technologies. I believe that there's always more to learn and master, and I find that these side projects truly enhance my growth by providing further practical, hands-on experience.<br><br>
You can reach me via email at c.williams.developer@gmail.com, or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cameron-williams-93318a238/) I am constantly wanting to learn and push my abilities. Please feel free to reach out about any opporutunites that I may be a good fit for. </p> <br><br>
