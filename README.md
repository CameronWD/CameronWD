- 👋 Hey, I’m Cameron! I'm a full-stack web developer with a passion for building interesting, user-friendly, and polished projects. I am a lifelong learner that enjoys understanding new technologies and problem-solving. With a background in management and mental health, I focus on user needs and ensure applications are accessible and intuitive. My experiences have also cultivated my skills in collaboration and teamwork. I believe in the power of diverse perspectives and I’m known for fostering positive relationships within teams to drive projects forward and achieve common goals.
- 👀  I’m interested in full-stack development with a particular interest in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). I enjoy developing responsive, user-centric web applications. I am very interested in the potential for AI and Machine Learning to enhance user experiences and am always eager to learn new ways to incorporate these technologies effectively into my projects.
